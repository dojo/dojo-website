<h3>Dojo Mobile and Builds</h3>
<p>
	Creating a build for Dojo Mobile applications is extremely important because we
	want our mobile applications to be a small as possible. Let's walk through the
	steps to create a compact build of our Dojo Mobile application: FlickrView.
</p>

<h3>Dojo's Build System</h3>
<img src="resources/folders.png" style="float:right;display:block;margin-left:20px;">
<p>
	Typical build scripts are found within the Dojo Toolkit's <code>util/buildscripts</code>
	directory, so, for the rest of the tutorial, you will need a local copy of a Dojo
	source distribution. If you don't have that already, visit
	<a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/download"
	   target="_blank">dojotoolkit.org/download</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Make sure you get a <strong>source</strong> distribution, that includes the
	<code>util</code> directory. Once you have that, copy the
	<code>dojo, dijit, dojox</code> and <code>util</code> directories
	into the <code>js</code> directory of your sample application. Your file structure
	should now be as follows.
</p>
<div class="clear"></div>

<h3>Build Profile</h3>
<p>
	Let's create a build profile for FlickrView. The build profile is a configuration
	file that says what the build will include, and what options are used. The Dojo
	build system is fully documented on the
	<a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.9/build/"
	   target="_blank">Creating Builds tutorial</a>, we will just explain briefly what
	it contains here.
</p>
<p>
	The profile starts with some <strong>options</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>"basePath"</code> defines the origin for all the relative paths in
		this profile;</li>
	<li><code>"action": "release"</code> is the standard action for a build</li>
	<li><code>"releaseDir"</code> specifies the directory where the
		build results will be output</li>
	<li><code>"cssOptimize"</code> option is useful for a mobile build
		since it makes sure all the CSS files that make up each theme are concatenated
		into one single CSS file</li>
</ul>

<pre class="brush: js;">
var profile = {
	"basePath": "./",
	"action": "release",
	"releaseDir": "../release/js",

	"selectorEngine": "acme",
	"stripConsole": "normal",
	"copyTests": false,
	"cssOptimize": "comments.keepLines",
	"mini": true,
	"optimize": "closure",
	"layerOptimize": "closure",

	"localeList": "en-us",
</pre>

<p>
	Next are the <strong>layers</strong> definition:
</p>
<p>
	In this tutorial, we define only one layer that contains all the modules needed by
	the application. A layer will result in one <code>.js</code> file being generated,
	and in our case, we define it as the dojo/dojo layer. It will include only the
	Dojo code that we actually use in our application, and the custom code that is
	specific to our application.
</p>
<p class="proTip">
	Note that we could have split our applications into multiple layers, for example one
	layer for the dojo code and one layer for the application code. But in the context
	of a mobile application deployed on networks with high latencies, having multiple
	requests could have a significant impact on the overall application launch time. For
	the same reason, we specify the builder to include the localized bundle into the
	layer (by means of the <code>includeLocales</code> property).
</p>

<pre class="brush: js;">
	layers: {
		"dojo/dojo": {
			customBase: true,
			includeLocales: ["en-us"],
			include: [
				"dojox/mobile/parser",
				"dijit/registry",
				"dojox/mobile/compat",
				"dojox/mobile/ScrollableView",
				"dojox/mobile/ListItem",
				"dojox/mobile/FormLayout",
				"dojox/mobile/TextBox",
				"dojox/mobile/RadioButton",
				"dojox/mobile/Heading",
				"dojox/mobile/EdgeToEdgeList",
				"dojox/mobile/RoundRect",
				"dojox/mobile/Switch",
				"dojo/cldr/nls/de/gregorian",
				"dojo/cldr/nls/fr/gregorian",
				"dojo/cldr/nls/it/gregorian",
				"dojo/cldr/nls/ko/gregorian",
				"dojo/cldr/nls/pt/gregorian",
				"dojo/cldr/nls/es/gregorian",
				"dojo/cldr/nls/zh/gregorian",
				"dojo/cldr/nls/zh-hk/gregorian",
				"flickrview/FeedView",
				"flickrview/SettingsView"
			]
		}
	},
</pre>

<p>
	Then we define a set of has <strong>features</strong>:
</p>
<p>
	Features are a way to isolate pieces of code that can be conditionally included or
	excluded (see dojo/has).
</p>
<p>
	For example, we set the <code>"ie"</code> feature to
	<code>undefined</code>: by this, we state that we don't want the application to run
	on old Internet Explorer (only on mobile browsers), so we accept that any
	IE-specific code is excluded from the build.
</p>

<pre class="brush: js;">
	staticHasFeatures: {
		"dom-addeventlistener": true,
		"dom-qsa": true,
		"json-stringify": true,
		"json-parse": true,
		"bug-for-in-skips-shadowed": false,
		"dom-matches-selector": true,
		"native-xhr": true,
		"array-extensible": true,
		"ie": undefined,
		"quirks": false,
		"dojo-sync-loader": false,
		"ie-event-behavior": 0
	},

	packages: [
		{ name: "dojo", location: "dojo" },
		{ name: "dijit", location: "dijit" },
		{ name: "dojox", location: "dojox" },
		{ name: "flickrview", location: "flickrview" }
	]
};
</pre>

<p class="proTip">
	This build profile is included as <code>flickrview/js/flickrview-app.profile.js</code>
	in the downloadable archive available at the end of this article.
</p>

<h3>Running the Build</h3>
<p>
	Let's switch to the command line and build our layers based on the build
	profile above:
</p>
<p><strong>Unix</strong></p>

<pre class="brush: js;">
cd js/util/buildscripts
./build.sh profile=../../flickrview-app.profile.js
</pre>
								<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>
<pre class="brush: js;">
cd js\util\buildscripts
.\build.bat profile=..\..\flickrview-app.profile.js
</pre>

<p>
	The build process is a mix of JavaScript and Java (for code
	minification/optimization) tasks. By default, the unix <code>build.sh</code> script
	uses <strong>node.js</strong> as the default runtime if available, or falls back
	to <strong>Rhino</strong> otherwise (this choice is motivated by the fact that
	<strong>node.js</strong> usually much more faster than <strong>Rhino</strong>).
</p>
<p>
	The Windows <code>build.bat</code> script, on the other hand, only leverages
	<strong>Rhino</strong>. But that does not mean you can’t build with
	<strong>node.js</strong> on windows! Here is the command line to do it manually:
</p>

<pre class="brush: js;">
.\node ..\..\dojo\dojo.js load=build --profile ../../flickrview-app.profile.js
</pre>

<p>
	After the build is completed, navigate to the <code>release/js/flickrview/</code>
	directory to view the result.
</p>
<h3>Implementing the Build</h3>
<p>
	To implement our newly created build files, update <code>flickrview.html</code>
</p>
<p>
	First, update the path to Dojo, so that we now use the <code>dojo.js</code> file
	that was created by the build instead of the original <code>dojo.js</code>.
	This corresponds to the <code>dojo/dojo</code> layer in our profile, and the
	resulting file is in <code>release/js/dojo/dojo.js</code>, so we update the path
	of the Dojo script tag accordingly. We don't need to do other modifications since
	the layer contains all the modules the application needs.
</p>

<pre class="brush: js; html-script: true;">
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="./release/js/dojo/dojo.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
	require([...], function(...){ // existing require calls
		// ... existing code
	});
	// ...
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>
	Finally, we can also simplify the <code>dojoConfig</code> section like this :
</p>

<pre class="brush: js; html-script: true;">
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
		dojoConfig = {
			async: true,
			parseOnLoad: false,
			mblHideAddressBar: true,
			extraLocale: ["en-us", "fr-fr", "de-de", "it-it", "ko-kr", "pt-br", "es-us", "zh-hk"]
		};
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p class="proTip">
	A build version of the HTML file, <code>flickrview-build.html</code>, is included in
	the downloadable archive. You can launch this file once you have run the build.
</p>

<h3>Review</h3>
<p>
	FlickrView is complete! Our simple mobile application has been templated (HTML),
	styled (CSS), coded (JavaScript), and built for production!
</p>
<p>
	Let's review what we learned in the process of create FlickrView:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The basic widgets included within Dojo Mobile</li>
	<li>The format which to declaratively code dojox/mobile widgets with HTML
		and programmatically create widgets with JavaScript
	</li>
	<li>How to use dojo/request/script to retrieve JSON-formatted data from Flickr</li>
	<li>How to extend dojox/mobile base widgets
	</li>
	<li>Strategies behind following good JavaScript practices but also keeping code compact and minimized in dependencies
	</li>
	<li>The special build process needed for dojox/mobile applications</li>
</ul>
<p>
	In this tutorial, we saw that Dojo Mobile is an outstanding mobile application
	framework complete with themes and widgets to match mobile device controls.
	Dojo Mobile is also easy to learn, extend, and dynamically populate with content.
	FlickrView, a basic three-view application, was very easy to create,
	thanks to Dojo Mobile!
